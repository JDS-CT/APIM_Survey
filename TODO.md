# TODO

âœ… [p1] Audit `interactive_3d_room_v1.html` to stop the scene from "falling" on load by correcting any viewport sizing or camera animation issues.
âœ… [p1] Restore orbit viewer buttons (Apply/Home) so they reliably update the scene and camera without console errors.
âœ… [p1] Add explicit Save and Load controls that persist the latest room layout export for reuse after navigating away.
âœ… [p1] Stand up a minimal Python HTTP server (Flask alternative) to serve the prototype and expose JSON save/load endpoints backed by a local file store.
âœ… [p2] Apply the shared glass-light dark theme tokens to the orbit viewer layout so the styling matches the rest of the prototype suite.
âœ… [p2] Persist imported or edited layout data client-side so it reloads automatically when the viewer opens.
ðŸ”² [p3] Catalog reusable "glass light" theme tokens for other room survey prototypes and expand the shared theme library as new looks emerge.
ðŸ”² [p3] Evaluate additional camera input affordances (e.g., touch gestures and keyboard shortcuts) for the 3D first-person demo after the next round of feedback.
