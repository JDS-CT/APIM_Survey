# Changelog

## 2024-05-08
- Added grid-snapped wall and door editing, wall edge labels, and delete-key support to `room_survey_min_v1.html` for a clearer custom-layout workflow.
- Captured the translucent "glass light" UI treatment as `dev/shared/styles/glass_light_theme.css` and wired it into the first-person 3D demo, along with control tips.
- Hardened `interactive_3d_room_fps_demo.html` for broader browser compatibility and added Ctrl-drag orbiting while outside walk mode.
