# TODO
âœ… [p1] Compare the orbit viewer markup against resources/testObjects/dozenSidedStack/mwe_x3d_box.html to spot missing X3D runtime requirements.
âœ… [p1] Refactor dev/interactive_3d_room/interactive_3d_room_v1.html so dynamically created nodes use the proper X3D namespace helper.
ðŸ”² [p1] Manually smoke-test the orbit viewer preset after refactor to confirm walls, grid, and furniture render (blocked: requires local browser run).
ðŸ”² [p1] Verify the FPS viewer control buttons (Enter Walk Mode, Reset) wire up correctly after persistence changes.
ðŸ”² [p3] Catalog reusable "glass light" theme tokens for other room survey prototypes and expand the shared theme library as new looks emerge.
ðŸ”² [p3] Evaluate additional camera input affordances (e.g., touch gestures and keyboard shortcuts) for the 3D first-person demo after the next round of feedback.
