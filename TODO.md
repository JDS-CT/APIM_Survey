# TODO

- Catalog reusable "glass light" theme tokens for other room survey prototypes and expand the shared theme library as new looks emerge.
- Evaluate additional camera input affordances (e.g., touch gestures and keyboard shortcuts) for the 3D first-person demo after the next round of feedback.
