# Agent Guidelines

- Prefer two-space indentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript prototypes inside the `dev/` directory.
- Keep prototype assets self-contained (no new build tooling) and favor vanilla browser APIs.
- When updating shared themes under `dev/shared/styles/`, document the change in `CHANGELOG.md` and add any follow-up tasks to `TODO.md`.
- Maintain reverse-chronological ordering in `CHANGELOG.md` entries.
- Use descriptive bullet lists (not numbered lists) when appending to `TODO.md`.
