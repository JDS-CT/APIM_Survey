# TODO
âœ… [p1] Clamp walk velocities to zero when no movement keys are active so the 3D viewers stop drifting when idle.
âœ… [p1] Add a translation snap control to the FPS demo and sync gizmo/hand-mode nudges to the selected increment.
ðŸ”² [p2] Extend regression tests to cover importing a saved layout and switching between tabs without losing state.
ðŸ”² [p2] Add an automated check that first-person mode stops moving when no input is pressed.
ðŸ”² [p2] Backfill regression coverage for the new FPS module loader path or document why automated coverage is deferred.
ðŸ”² [p3] Catalog reusable "glass light" theme tokens for other room survey prototypes and expand the shared theme library as new looks emerge.
ðŸ”² [p3] Evaluate additional camera input affordances (e.g., touch gestures and keyboard shortcuts) for the 3D first-person demo after the next round of feedback.
ðŸ”² [p3] Gate the FPS "Enter Walk Mode" button when pointer lock is unsupported and surface a toast to clarify the disabled state.
